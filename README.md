# Autonomous Robotics Systems

This repository contains our group's work for the course Autonomous Robotics Systems. In particular, the assignments contain demonstrations of:

1. Particle Swarm Optimisation applied on 2 benchmark functions, along with visualisation of results.
2. An environment for the simulation of a dust-collecting robot in a room, complete with collision handling (written with Pygame).
3. The use of Evolutionary Algorithms for the training of a Neural Network which controls the dust-collecting robot in the simulated environment.
